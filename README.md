Third print for Open Source 3D Fabrication.

The assignment for my third print was to work in a group to create objects that connect to other objects. My group chose to use kitchen tools such as an apple cutter and a can opener. My portion of the piece was to create something that connects a pencil to the gear of the can opener. Upon printing I descovered that I needed to thicken the support material and put a fan in front of the printer to cool the material faster.
